# Amazon Product Reviews

## Project Overview
Analyzing Amazon Vine members data to see if it will have a higher yield in ratting reviews. If so is it a good move for the company to pay for these services.

## Results

-  How many Vine reviews and non-reviews were there? 
	-Vine Reviews: 47
	-Non-Vine Reviews: 8,362

-  How many Vine reviews and Non-Vine were 5 stars
	- 5 Stars Vine reviews: 15
	- 5 Starts Non-Vine reviews: 4,332

- What percentage of Vine users and non-Vine user’s reviews were 5 stars?
	-Percentage of vine 5 star users: 32%
	- Percentage of Non-Vine 5 star users: 52%

## Summary
 - In all the data pulled for this shows that paying the small feed is not worth what you get. With that t said this data collected only cover the 5 stars reviews.  I think if you collect the data for all the review ratting that you can see a better picture.  It’s fun to see where we are doing good, but we need to see why the one star reviews are getting likes.  Without failure there is no improvement. If the Vine users grows bigger this might be something to think about for the future but not right now.
